      <h3>Mozyr Beginnings</h3>
      <p>I was born and grew up in Mozyr, a small city in the Gomel region of Belarus. For eight years, I was seriously into swimming. Early mornings, regular competitions, and lots of practice taught me discipline and how to keep going even when it’s hard.</p>

      <h3>School No. 9 &amp; Firefighters Club</h3>
      <p>At School No. 9, I balanced studies with student council activities and joined the local young-firefighters club. That’s where I first encountered C++ and realized how much I enjoy solving problems—especially when there’s some pressure and a deadline.</p>

      <h3>BSTU, Minsk</h3>
      <p>I am currently studying at the Belarusian State Technological University in Minsk. In parallel with my studies, I work on freelance projects: mostly front-end development, but also constantly learning new things. This is a great way to continue learning and apply skills in real tasks.</p>

      <h3>Next Up: Profitable Startups</h3>
      <p>In the evenings, I train in boxing and keep experimenting with ideas for future projects. I’m aiming to build successful startups and work with people who are also excited about creating something valuable. I’d love to connect and collaborate with those who share the same drive.</p>
